***** Phase II *****
1. Add a button on the bottom right. This is the timezone selector

2. Add a table to the right of the button. Table should be a 2 rows by 3 columns.
Each cell in the table itself will have 2 rows. Top is current time in the timezone,
bottom is the name of the time zone. For example:

|  8:15 AM  |
| Mountain  |

3. When the user clicks the selector button, the table should display. The end user can
then click on one of the buttons to select

4. Clicking on the selector should hide the table if it's showing.

Clock

Clock is a mini-project. Basic purpose of this project is just to give
me practice with building a simple website application with Javascript.

This application allows a user to add a subset of timezones, save them as
a shortcut on the HTML page, and switch them with the main clock, and remove
timezones.

No libraries other than jQuery were used in order to gain practice with vanilla
JS. Timezones are limited to a 5 American timezones.
